<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I love Music and Code. On code, i first touch code when i was 11 grade and on Music i touch music since i was 3 grade. Most of time im thinknig about
  how could i do this all together at the same time, but now i found the answer, when im stressed on code i go play some music, even tho i know muisc sometimes
  give me stressed too. But most of time stressed came from code, but believe me its a good stress tho.
</p>

<p>I have learned html before, even my first code was html and css but i dont know what im writing at that time. So deciced to learn from basic
  my brother buy me this course so i can learn from begining and structured. For now i love how the structured that this course gave. Ill try to enjoy
  every topic and step.

  i dont have anything on my mind anymore when writing this so lets continue.
